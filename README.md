# Password Maker

This project is a password maker coded in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to generate random passwords based on their preferences. The project consists of three files and one image.

## Files

1. `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that contains the structure and layout of the password maker web application. It includes references to the CSS and JavaScript files.

2. `index.js`: This file contains the JavaScript code that handles the password generation logic. It defines different data sets for lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The code uses checkboxes and a range input to allow users to customize the password length and character types. When the "Generate" button is clicked, a random password is generated based on the selected options and displayed in the password output field.

3. `style.css`: This file contains the CSS styles that define the appearance and layout of the password maker application. It includes styles for the main container, password output field, range input, checkboxes, and the generate button.
